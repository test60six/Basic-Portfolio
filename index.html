<p class="fonts"> Hello all! My name is Dennis Gruszka. Here is a little bit about myself. 
I grew up in a small town called Leroy Township in Northeast Ohio. I went to High School at Riverside High in Painesville. Some of my hobbies include beer and wine making,gardening,woodworking,fishing,target shooting and making ammunition. I also have been playing the drums since I was in 5th grade. I can't beleive that was over 20 years ago! About nine years ago some friends and I started a band called Midnight Buford. We write all of our own music and have formed our own genre called 'Junk Rock'. We all enjoy playing together still to this day.</p> </div>

<p class="fonts"> Some of my work history includes resturant management,assembly and testing work,and medical research. For the last 10 years I worked in research studying Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease. I have two publicatons. One is in PlosOne and the other is in The Journal of Immunology. I am currenty studying coding and web development at Case Western Reserve University. After a decade I feel it is time to learn some new skills and change careers. </p> </div>
